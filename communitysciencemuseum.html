        <h2>Changes I made:</h2>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>I changed how the dropdown searchbar looked and placement. Now it fits better with the rest of the
                design. It also looks much better and is easier to use as it is larger now. I considered removing
                the searchbar entierly since I did not get to make it work in time. I would also like to know how to
                do that when it is not searching for a specific product from an api but rather text in a html. How
                would one go about displaing the search results? Show the entire section that the has the results in
                them on a seperate page or take the user to the page that has the results? But then what do you do
                when there is more then one page that has the results?</p>
            <p>Some general fixes as removing the margin on the body and fixing the label for the inputs that did
                not have id's.</p>
            <p>I fixed the images so they dont stretch, I did this with the object-fit: cover style</p>
            <p>Fixed the alt text on images so it is not as long as it was.</p>
            <p>I had feedback that the meta description was too short so I have now added more info.</p>
            <p>I would have liked to change the Events, Exhibit and Explore pages so they were more inviting, as
                they are quite similar still but there was not enough time for this. The same goes for About us, Get
                involved and Visit us pages.</p>
            <p>I wanted to add a home button in the nav, but then I had to just have a hamburgermenu there instead
                of the text on larger screens since there was not enough room in the nav. I did not want it to do
                this as I wanted it to be as accessible as possible for people that use
                desktops, it also makes more sense with regards to interaction design.</p>
            <p>I added a hover effect on the items in the nav menu so the user easier can see what they are clicking.
            </p>

        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>Index page</h3>
            <p>I fixed the sidewas scrollbar that appeared on screen sizes below 420px. It was an issue with the
                banner image.</p>
            <p>I added a more inviting front page with a h1 of welcome and an image.</p>
            <p>I added a hover effect on the containers so the user would easier be able to recognise that the
                container is clickable.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>Booking page</h3>
            <p>I added a function to check all the inputs per form. I also added a date input for the booking form
                and made the function check that a date was selected.</p>
