            <h2>General thoughts on this CA</h2>
            <p>This was a very hard Course assignment to get motivated for. Having spent five weeks on the project exam
                and then going straight to another delivery for another 2 weeks was hard. I do see the value of it in
                both learing to revisit our code and see what changes can be made, but also just for the experience of
                seeing how far along I have come from the cross course assignment to the project exam.</p>
            <p>There was still many things I did not get to do, but I had to just set a cut off time. Especially with
                the cross course project. That project would be best to scrap and start all over again. But there
                is never enough time. I do feel I made good improvements to all of the projects and I am happy with most
                of
                them. Even the cross course project got a little better.</p>
