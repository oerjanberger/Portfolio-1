        <h2>Changes I made:</h2>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>I did not like the look of the product containers, so I had to make some changes to them. I removed the
                border and added a cta that lets the user know the product is clickable. I the added a slight hover
                effect when the container is hovered by adding underline to the name and a green shadow to the cta</p>
            <p>Small bug fixes that has been commented by teachers, such as not all pages have an h1 or its own title
                and meta description. Images that where above 200px are now below that and I fixed the resolution on the
                images that I could still was access on unpslashed.com, I had unfortunatley removed the originals from
                my pc and the uploading photographer had removed them from the website.</p>
            <p>Tried to make the CSS follow the DRY principle more then it did before. I have removed several css pages
                that where duplicates. I would have liked to remove all the pages and start over again from scrath, the
                same as with the html. This is because as we have progressed this year I just see so manny mistakes that
                I have made previously. This also makes the code really hard to maintaine as I am struggling with what
                classes styles which parts of the html. Sometimes I would change something and the next day find that
                another page had been completly ruined, so then I had to fix that. It's a never ending circle.</p>
            <p>I removed the searchbar from the header and moved it to the category specific pages. It made more sense
                to have it there.</p>
            <p>There is still alot to do on this page and every time I start working on it I am frustrated by how much
                there is to do and how little time I have to do it</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>Index page</h3>
            <p>I started where I left of on the interaction design CA and finished the banner and made it responisve and
                fit the screen size better. I then changed the text to stand out better on the image </p>
            <p>I wanted the site to look more interesting so I added a featured product section where I get the products
                with an api call and show the featured products. I made sure to only show three by adding per_page=3 to
                the url</p>
            <p>I had gotten feedback that the nav menu should be the same on all pages so I made that quick change and I
                agree that it makes more sense.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>The product catergory pages</h3>
            <p>I made the search function work so it looks for the products on the specific page if it contains the word
                or letters in the searchbar. This will update as they write, I therefor had to have a min height on the
                container for the products so the page did not jump from one size to the next every time a key was
                typed. I had to also set the height and width for the searchbar for the same reason.</p>
            <p>I also styled the searchbar a little different.</p>
            <p>On the "All" category page I made the category filter for Unisex, Women and Men work. It will only show
                the products from the last checkbox that was checked. I did not get around to fix that. </p>
            <p>I did not get the price high, price low and so on, filter to work yet.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feedback-ca-section">
            <h3>Product specific page</h3>
            <p>I made the hart clickable to show you could add a product to your favorites but I did not get around to
                having it add the product to the favorites page</p>
            <p>The same goes for add to cart and add to wishlist. I made a pop up modal that shows for 1.5seconds that
                says the product is added, but did not have time to actually make the function that added the product
            </p>
            <p>I made a function that checks if the product is in stock or out of stock and shows that on the page by
                changing the text and symbol from green to red</p>
            <p>I added an image modal to the main image on the product page. I would have liked it so the images could
                be scrolled in the modal and so the image that is clicked in the carousel is the one that is shown, but
                there was not enough time.</p>
